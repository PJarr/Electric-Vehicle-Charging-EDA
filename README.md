# Electric-Vehicle-Charging-EDA

## About Dataset

A team led by public policy professor Omar Asensio used a field experiment to collect data on 3,395 electric vehicle charging sessions between November 2014 and October 2015. The dataset “contains sessions from 85 EV drivers with repeat usage at 105 stations across 25 sites at a workplace charging program”; it indicates the date and length of each session, total energy used, cost, and more.

## The Aim of the Analysis

The main objective is to carry out exploratory data analysis that will help to answers questions:

1. What patterns emerge in the energy consumption of electric vehicles per charging session?
2. How long does it typically take to charge an electric vehicle?
3. On which days of the week do electric vehicles undergo the most charging sessions?
4. What is the average charging duration of electric vehicles broken down by day of the week?
5. What is the relationship between energy consumption and charging time for electric vehicles?
6. How does the charging cost of electric vehicles correlate with their charging time?
7. What is the average cost per unit of charging electric vehicles on each day of the week?
8. Which charging facilities are the most popular among electric vehicle users?
9. What is the average cost per unit of charging at different charging facilities?
